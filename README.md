# Poem & Story Generator Project

This project automatically generates illustrated children's stories and compiles them into beautiful PDFs using AI language and image models. You only need to provide a list of story themes (in Excel), and the app will do the rest!

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: I get a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `src` or `utils`.**
- Always run scripts from the project root folder (where `src/` is located).
- Or use the Streamlit app, which handles paths for you.

**Q: Where do my results go?**
- Stories, images, and PDFs are saved in `data/output/` subfolders.

**Q: How do I get an API key?**
- Sign up at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/), go to your settings, and create a new token.

**Q: Can I use my own story themes?**
- Yes! Just put them in an Excel file and upload via the app or place in `data/input/`.
