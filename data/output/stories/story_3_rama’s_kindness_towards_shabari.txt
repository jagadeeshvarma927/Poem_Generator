### The Sweetest Berries

Deep in a sun-dappled forest, the noble prince Rama and his brother Lakshmana were searching for Rama's beloved wife, Sita. Tired and thirsty, they came upon a small, peaceful hut.

An old woman with kind, wrinkled eyes and a heart full of love lived there. Her name was Shabari. For many, many years, Shabari had waited for this day. Her wise teacher had told her that one day, Lord Rama himself would visit her humble home.

When she saw Rama, her eyes filled with happy tears. "Oh, Rama!" she cried. "You are finally here!"

She wanted to offer him the best food she had. She hurried to a basket filled with juicy, wild berries she had picked that morning. To make sure she only gave the sweetest ones to her special guest, she took a tiny bite of each berry first. If it was sweet, she placed it in a clean leaf bowl. If it was sour, she put it aside.

Lakshmana watched, a little worried. "Brother," he whispered, "she has already tasted them!"

But Rama smiled gently at Shabari. He saw not the half-eaten fruit, but the mountain of love in her heart. He lovingly took the berries and ate them with great joy.

"Shabari," he said, his voice full of warmth, "these are the most delicious fruits I have ever tasted, for they are sweetened with your pure love."

Shabari's heart felt as light as a feather. Her long wait was over, and her simple gift was accepted by her beloved Lord.

**Moral of the story:** It is not what you give, but the love and devotion with which you give it that truly matters. A simple gift from a pure heart is more precious than all the treasures in the world.
