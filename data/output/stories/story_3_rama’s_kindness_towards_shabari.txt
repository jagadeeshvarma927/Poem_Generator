Deep in a quiet forest lived a kind, elderly woman named Shabari. Every day, she would clean the path to her little hut, gather the sweetest wild berries, and wait. Her great teacher had told her that one day, the noble Prince Rama would visit her.

Years passed, and Shabari grew old, but her faith never wavered.

One sunny morning, two tired princes arrived at her doorstep. It was Rama and his brother, Lakshmana! Shabariâ€™s eyes sparkled with happy tears. She lovingly offered Rama the berries she had collected.

To ensure each berry was perfectly sweet, she took a tiny bite first before giving it to him. Lakshmana was surprised, but Rama smiled gently. He wasn't looking at the half-eaten fruit; he was looking at the pure love and devotion in Shabari's heart. He ate the berries gratefully, tasting her kindness in every bite.

Her lifelong wish fulfilled, Shabari felt a deep, peaceful joy.

**Moral of the story:** True kindness and love in your heart are more precious than any rich gift. God sees our devotion, not just our offerings.
