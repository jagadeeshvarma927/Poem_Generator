Deep in a sun-dappled forest lived an old, kind woman named Shabari. Her heart was full of love for Prince Rama. Every single day, she cleaned her little hut and went to the forest to pick the sweetest, juiciest berries, hoping he would one day visit.

To make sure only the best ones reached Rama, she would take a tiny bite of each berry. If it was sweet, she kept it. If it was sour, she threw it away.

Years passed, and Shabari grew very old. Then, one magical morning, Rama and his brother Lakshmana arrived at her doorstep!

Shabari’s eyes filled with happy tears. With trembling hands, she offered Rama her basket of half-bitten berries. Lakshmana was surprised, but Rama smiled warmly.

He lovingly took the berries and said, “Each of these berries is sweetened with your devotion, Shabari. They are the most precious food I have ever eaten.” He ate them with great joy, filling Shabari's heart with peace and happiness.

**Moral of the story:** True love and kindness are more valuable than any riches. It is the feeling behind a gift, not the gift itself, that truly matters.
