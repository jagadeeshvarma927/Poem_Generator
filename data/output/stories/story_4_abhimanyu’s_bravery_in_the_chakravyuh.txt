In the great war of Mahabharata, the wicked Kauravas created a deadly trap called the Chakravyuh—a spinning wheel of soldiers, impossible to break.

The mighty Pandavas were worried. Who could face this challenge?

Suddenly, the brave young prince Abhimanyu, son of the great archer Arjuna, stepped forward. "I can do it!" he declared. He had learned the secret of entering the Chakravyuh while he was still a baby in his mother Subhadra’s tummy, listening to his father.

Like a flash of lightning, Abhimanyu charged into the maze on his chariot. Inside, he fought like a young lion, defeating powerful warriors one by one. His arrows flew like shooting stars!

Though he was alone and trapped, his heart knew no fear. He fought with incredible skill and courage, amazing even his enemies. He fought to protect his family’s honor until his very last breath.

**Moral of the story:** Abhimanyu’s tale, much like the courage of Jatayu trying to save Sita in the Ramayana, teaches us that true bravery isn't about winning. It's about facing your biggest fears with all your heart and fighting for what is right, no matter how difficult it seems.
