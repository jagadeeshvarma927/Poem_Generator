On the grand battlefield of Kurukshetra, the evil Kauravas created a giant, spinning maze of soldiers called the Chakravyuh. It was a trap, and the brave Pandavas were worried.

Stepping forward was young Abhimanyu, the brilliant son of the great archer Arjuna. "I can break the formation!" he announced. While in his mother's womb, he had heard his father explain how to enter the Chakravyuh, but he had fallen asleep before hearing how to exit.

Knowing he might not return, Abhimanyu charged in alone for the honor of his family.

Like a fearless lion cub, he stormed through the maze, defeating mighty warriors one by one. His arrows flew like lightning! The Kauravas were stunned by his courage. Even though he was trapped and all alone, the young prince fought with the strength of a hundred heroes. He became a shining star of bravery that day, a legend whose story would inspire everyone forever.

**Moral of the story:** True courage is not about being fearless, but about doing what is right and facing challenges with all your heart, even when you are scared.
