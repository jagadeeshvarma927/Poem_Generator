### Abhimanyu, the Young Tiger

In the time of the great Mahabharata war, there was a young prince named Abhimanyu. He was the son of the mighty archer Arjuna and was as brave and bright as the morning sun.

One day, the enemy Kaurava army, led by their clever teacher Dronacharya, created a fearsome battle formation called the **Chakravyuh**. It was a giant, spinning wheel of soldiers, a deadly puzzle that no one could solve.

The Pandavas were worried. Who could break this trap?

Young Abhimanyu, who was only sixteen, stepped forward. "I can!" he announced.

His uncle, Yudhishthira, was surprised. "But how, my child? Even your father is not here to help."

Abhimanyu smiled bravely. "When I was a baby in my mother Subhadra's womb, I heard my father explaining how to enter the Chakravyuh. I know the way in!" But he had fallen asleep before his father could explain the way out.

Trusting his courage, the Pandavas agreed. "We will follow right behind you!" they promised.

Like a young tiger, Abhimanyu charged, breaking the first gate of the Chakravyuh with his brilliant archery. But as soon as he was inside, the evil warrior Jayadratha, using a special boon from Lord Shiva, sealed the entrance behind him. Abhimanyu was trapped inside, all alone!

Surrounded by the greatest Kaurava warriors, he did not tremble. He fought with the skill of his father and the courage of a lion, defeating many powerful enemies. He fought for hours, a single bright flame against a dark storm.

Though he was alone, his spirit was unbreakable.

**Moral of the story:**
True bravery is not always about winning. It is about standing up for what is right and facing your greatest fears with all your heart, even if you have to stand alone. Abhimanyu's courage became a legend that inspires heroes forever.
