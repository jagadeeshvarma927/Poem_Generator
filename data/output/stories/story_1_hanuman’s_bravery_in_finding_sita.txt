Hanuman, the mighty monkey warrior, saw his beloved Lord Rama with a sad heart. The wicked demon king, Ravana, had captured the beautiful Princess Sita and hidden her on his island kingdom of Lanka.

A vast, roaring ocean stood between them and Sita. While everyone else wondered what to do, Hanuman’s heart filled with courage. He chanted Lord Rama’s name, and a magical power flowed through him. He grew bigger, and bigger, until he was as tall as a mountain!

With a mighty roar, **"Jai Shri Ram!"** (Victory to Lord Rama!), Hanuman took a giant leap. He flew across the sky like a golden arrow, soaring over the massive waves below.

In Lanka, he bravely snuck past giant demons and finally found Sita in a beautiful garden called the Ashoka Vatika. He gave her Rama’s ring, assuring her that help was on its way. Hanuman’s single act of bravery brought hope to everyone.

**Moral of the story:** With courage in your heart and faith in doing the right thing, no ocean is too wide and no challenge is too big.
