### Hanuman's Great Leap

Prince Rama’s heart was heavy. The wicked demon king Ravana had kidnapped his beloved wife, Sita, and hidden her on the island of Lanka.

The mighty Hanuman, son of the Wind God, stepped forward. "Do not worry, my Lord! I will find Mother Sita," he promised.

But a vast, roaring ocean stood between him and Lanka. Hanuman smiled, remembering his divine powers. Chanting "Jai Shri Ram!", he grew bigger and bigger until he was as tall as a mountain!

With a mighty push, he leaped into the air. He soared through the clouds like a golden arrow, flying over the giant waves. On reaching Lanka, he shrank back to the size of a small monkey and searched for Sita.

He found her in a beautiful garden, the Ashoka Vatika, looking sad. Hanuman gently gave her Prince Rama’s ring. Seeing it, Sita’s eyes filled with hope. Hanuman promised that Rama would come to rescue her soon.
