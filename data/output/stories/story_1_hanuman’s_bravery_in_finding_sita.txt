In the heart of the forest, Lord Rama was very sad. The evil demon king, Ravana, had taken his beloved wife, Sita, to his faraway kingdom of Lanka.

Seeing his friend’s tears, a mighty hero stepped forward. It was Hanuman, the brave and strong monkey god! “Do not worry, Lord Rama,” he said, his voice full of courage. “I will find Mother Sita!”

Hanuman grew as big as a mountain. With a mighty roar of **“Jai Shri Ram!”** he took a giant leap into the sky. He flew across the vast blue ocean, faster than the wind. Fearsome sea monsters rose from the waves, but Hanuman swatted them away like tiny flies.

He landed on the golden island of Lanka and searched everywhere. Finally, in a beautiful garden called the Ashoka Vatika, he found Sita, looking sad under a tree.

Hanuman quietly gave her Rama’s ring. Seeing it, Sita’s eyes filled with hope! Hanuman promised her that Rama would come to rescue her soon.

**Moral of the story:** *With courage in your heart and faith in doing good, no problem is too big to overcome.*
