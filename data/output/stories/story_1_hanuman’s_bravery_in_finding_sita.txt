In the heart of a lush, green forest, Prince Rama was very sad. The wicked ten-headed king, Ravana, had stolen his beloved wife, Sita, and taken her to his faraway island kingdom of Lanka.

Rama’s most loyal friend, Hanuman, the mighty monkey god, saw his lord’s sorrow. Hanuman had the strength of mountains and a heart full of courage. "Do not worry, my Lord," he boomed, puffing out his chest. "I will find Mother Sita!"

But Lanka was across the great, roaring ocean. How could he get there?

Hanuman stood at the edge of the sea. He took a deep breath, thought of Rama, and began to grow. He grew bigger and bigger, until he was as tall as a golden hill! With a mighty push from his powerful legs and a thunderous cry of **"Jai Shri Ram!"** (Victory to Lord Rama!), he leaped into the air.

He flew like a golden arrow across the sky, over the deep blue water.

Hanuman landed softly in Lanka and searched everywhere. He finally found a beautiful garden called the Ashoka Vatika. There, under a tree, sat Sita, looking very sad.

Quietly, Hanuman dropped Rama’s ring in front of her. When Sita saw it, her eyes filled with tears of hope! She knew Rama had sent his brave friend.

"Rama will come to save you," Hanuman whispered gently. "Just be brave a little longer."

Filled with joy, Hanuman leaped back across the ocean to tell Rama the wonderful news.

**Moral of the story:** No matter how big the challenge seems, with courage and love in your heart, you can overcome any obstacle.
