**Title: The Colors of Kindness**

In a vibrant village, the air buzzed with excitement as children prepared for Holi. Three friends, Rohan, Aisha, and Karan, eagerly gathered their colors and sweets. As they played, they noticed some poor children watching from a distance, their eyes wide with longing.

Rohan whispered, "Look, they want to join but can't." Aisha nodded, and Karan suggested, "Let's share our colors and sweets!" They approached the poor children, offering them the festive treats.

Just then, a gentle voice spoke, "Your hearts are as colorful as the Holi hues." It was Lord Rama, appearing with a warm smile. "Kindness is the greatest virtue," he said. "Remember, sharing brings joy to all."

The children beamed, learning that true happiness comes from kindness. From that day on, they celebrated Holi with everyone, spreading joy and colors to all.

**Moral:** Kindness and sharing bring the greatest joy, as taught by Lord Rama.
