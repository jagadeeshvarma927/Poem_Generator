On a golden afternoon, the five Pandava princes played joyfully on the banks of the river Ganga. The riverbed was their favourite playground, filled with smooth, colourful stones.

"Let's see who can make a stone fly!" challenged the mighty Bhima. He picked up the biggest rock he could find and hurled it into the water with a mighty **KER-PLUNK!** It sank instantly, making a huge splash that made everyone giggle.

Then came Arjun, known for his focus. He didn't pick a big rock. He chose a small, flat stone. With a graceful flick of his wrist, he sent it spinning across the water's surface. *Skip... skip... skip-skip-skip!* The little stone danced like a happy fish all the way to the other bank.

Bhima laughed and patted his brother on the back. "Your skill is as powerful as my strength, Arjun!"

**Moral of the story:**
True strength isn't just about muscle. Skill, cleverness, and practice are also great powers. Everyone has their own special talent that makes them wonderful.
