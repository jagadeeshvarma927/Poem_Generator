The great Vanara army stood at the edge of a giant, roaring ocean. Their hearts were heavy. Lanka, where the noble Sita was held captive by Ravana, was on the other side. But how could they possibly cross?

Everyone felt hopeless. Even the mighty Hanuman sat quietly, staring at the waves, feeling small and unsure. He had forgotten his own amazing abilities.

The wise old bear king, Jambavan, saw Hanuman's doubt. He walked over and spoke with a deep, kind voice.

"Hanuman, son of the Wind God, why do you sit in silence? Have you forgotten your power? As a child, you leaped towards the sun, thinking it was a ripe mango! You can grow as large as a mountain and fly faster than any storm. You are the one who can cross this ocean!"

As Hanuman listened, he felt a magical tingle. Jambavanâ€™s words awakened his memory! He grew bigger and stronger, his eyes shining with courage.

"I remember!" Hanuman roared, his voice like thunder. "I will leap across this ocean for Lord Rama!"

**Moral of the story:** Sometimes, we forget how strong and special we are. A few words of encouragement from a wise friend can help us remember our own hidden powers.
