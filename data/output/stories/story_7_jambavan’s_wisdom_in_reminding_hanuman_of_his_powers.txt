### The Forgotten Hero

The great Vanara army, led by Sugriva, stood at the edge of the wide, blue ocean. On the other side was the island of Lanka, where the kind Princess Sita was being held by the wicked Ravana. Everyone was sad. The ocean was too big to cross.

"What will we do?" a young monkey warrior sighed. "How will we ever reach Sita?"

Among them sat Hanuman, the strongest and bravest of all. But even he looked at the endless water with a worried face. Long ago, as a child, Hanuman had been so powerful and mischievous that he was cursed to forget his own strength. He felt small and helpless.

Just then, the old and wise bear-king, Jambavan, walked up to him. He saw the doubt in Hanuman’s eyes.

“Hanuman,” Jambavan said in his deep, calm voice. “Why do you sit silently? Have you forgotten who you are? You are the son of Vayu, the Wind God! You can grow as big as a mountain and leap across any sea. This ocean is just a small puddle for you!”

Hearing these words was like a key unlocking a door in Hanuman's mind. He felt a tingling power rush through him. He remembered!

Hanuman’s eyes sparkled. He began to grow taller and taller, his body glowing like a golden hill. With a mighty roar of “Jai Shri Ram!”, he bent his powerful legs and leaped into the air. He soared across the sky like a shooting star, a hero ready to complete his mission.

**Moral of the story:**
Sometimes, we all forget how strong and special we are. A few words of encouragement from a friend or elder can help us remember our own hidden powers.
