The mighty Vanara army stood at the edge of a vast, roaring ocean. They had found where Ravana had hidden Sita—on the island of Lanka! But how could they cross the endless water? Everyone felt hopeless.

Even the brave Hanuman sat quietly, staring at the waves. He felt small and powerless, having forgotten his own divine gifts.

Just then, wise old Jambavan, the king of the bears, walked up to him. With a kind smile, he said, "Hanuman, my son, why do you sit in silence? Have you forgotten who you are?"

"You are the son of Vayu, the Wind God! As a baby, you leaped thousands of miles into the sky, thinking the bright sun was a juicy mango. This tiny ocean is nothing for you!"

Hearing these words, Hanuman’s eyes widened. He remembered! A powerful energy surged through him. He grew bigger and stronger, until he was as tall as a mountain. With a mighty roar, he declared, “I remember! For Lord Ram, I will cross this ocean!”

**Moral of the story:** Sometimes we forget how strong and special we are. A wise friend’s encouragement can help us remember our own hidden powers.
