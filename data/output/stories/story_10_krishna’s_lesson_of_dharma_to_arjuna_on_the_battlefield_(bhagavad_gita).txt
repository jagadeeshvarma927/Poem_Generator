### The Prince's Difficult Duty

On the great battlefield of Kurukshetra, mighty armies stood like two oceans ready to clash. Prince Arjuna, the world's greatest archer, sat in his chariot, his famous bow Gandiva by his side.

But as he looked at the army opposite him, his hands began to tremble. He saw his own dear grandfather, Bhishma, and his beloved teacher, Dronacharya.

“Krishna,” he whispered to his best friend and charioteer. “How can I fight my own family? I cannot raise my bow against them. It is better to lose than to harm the ones I love.” Arjuna’s eyes filled with tears, and he dropped his bow.

Krishna smiled gently. “Arjuna, my brave friend, listen. You are a warrior. Your duty, your *dharma*, is to fight for what is right and just. The other side has chosen the path of unfairness.”

He continued, “Think of Hanuman, who had to burn Lanka to help rescue Sita. It was a difficult task, but it was his duty to help Lord Rama. Your duty now is to stand for truth, not for yourself. Do your job with a brave heart, and don’t worry about the results. That is true strength.”

Arjuna looked at Krishna, and his friend’s words filled him with courage. He understood. This was not a fight against his family, but a fight for justice. He picked up his Gandiva, his hands now steady.

**Moral of the story:**
Our most important duty, our *dharma*, is to always do the right thing, even when it’s the hardest thing to do. True courage lies in following the path of truth and fairness.
