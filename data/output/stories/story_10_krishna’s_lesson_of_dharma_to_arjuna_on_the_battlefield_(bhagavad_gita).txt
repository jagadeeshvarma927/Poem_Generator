On the great battlefield of Kurukshetra, the mighty warrior Arjuna looked across at the opposing army. His heart sank. He saw his cousins, the Kauravas, and even his wise teacher, Dronacharya.

"My hands are trembling," he told his friend and charioteer, Krishna. "I cannot fight my own family! I will drop my bow, Gandiva."

Krishna, with a calm and loving smile, placed a hand on Arjuna’s shoulder. “Arjuna,” he said, “your duty as a Pandava prince is to stand up for what is right. The Kauravas have chosen a path of darkness and unfairness.”

He continued, “It is your dharma—your special job—to fight for truth. Do not worry about winning or losing. Just do your duty with a brave and pure heart. Standing up for good is the most important thing, even when it’s hard.”

Hearing Krishna’s divine words, Arjuna’s confusion vanished. He understood. He picked up his powerful bow, ready to fight for justice.

**Moral of the story:** Sometimes, the right thing to do is also the hardest thing to do. We must always choose the path of duty and righteousness, no matter the obstacle.
