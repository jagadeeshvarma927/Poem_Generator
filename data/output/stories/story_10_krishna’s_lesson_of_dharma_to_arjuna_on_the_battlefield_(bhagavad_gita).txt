Prince Arjuna, the world's greatest archer, stood in his magnificent chariot on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. His heart sank when he saw his own cousins and beloved teacher, Drona, in the army opposite him.

His mighty bow, the Gandiva, slipped from his trembling hands. "I cannot fight my family, Krishna," he whispered to his charioteer and best friend. "It is wrong!"

Lord Krishna smiled gently. "Arjuna," he said, his voice calm and clear, "your duty, your *dharma*, is to stand up for what is right. This battle is not about you or your cousins. It is a fight against injustice."

He explained that as a warrior, Arjuna's role was to protect truth and fairness. Hiding from his duty would be the bigger mistake.

Arjuna looked into Krishna's wise eyes and understood. His sadness was replaced by a sense of purpose. He picked up his Gandiva, his heart filled with courage. He was ready to follow his dharma.

**Moral of the story:** Always do your duty and stand for what is right, even when it is the hardest thing to do. That is the path of dharma.
