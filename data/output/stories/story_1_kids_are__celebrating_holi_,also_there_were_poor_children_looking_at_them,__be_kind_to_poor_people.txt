Rohan and Priya laughed, their faces a rainbow of pink and green. With water guns (*pichkaris*) in hand, they celebrated Holi with their friends. The air smelled of sweet *gujiyas* and joyful shouts of "Holi Hai!"

But then, Rohan noticed two children standing near the gate. Their clothes were faded, and they had no colours to play with. They just watched, their eyes wide with longing.

Rohan felt a little sad. He remembered the story of Lord Rama from the Ramayana. When Rama met the humble Shabari in the forest, she offered him berries she had already tasted to make sure they were sweet. Lord Rama didn't care that she was poor; he saw her love and ate them happily.

"Priya," Rohan whispered, "Let's be like Lord Rama."

Priya understood at once. They ran to the children, holding out their packets of bright yellow *gulal* and a plate of *gujiyas*. "Come and play with us!" they smiled.

The childrenâ€™s faces lit up. Soon, all four were laughing and chasing each other, covered in a beautiful mess of colours.

**Moral of the story:** True joy comes from sharing. Just as Lord Rama showed kindness to Shabari, we should always be kind and include everyone in our celebrations.
