### The Sleepless Guardian

Deep in a vast, whispering forest lived the noble Prince Rama, his gentle wife Sita, and his ever-loyal brother, Lakshmana. During their exile, the forest was filled with strange sounds and shadows at night.

While Rama and Sita slept peacefully in their small leaf hut, Lakshmana made a solemn promise. He would not sleep for all fourteen years of their exile, so he could be their guardian.

Every single night, he stood watch with his bow and arrow held ready. His eyes, sharp and alert, scanned the darkness. He listened for the snap of a twig or the soft pad of unseen paws. He was a silent, unblinking protector, a living shield built of love and courage. He faced every danger so that Rama and Sita could rest without fear. His dedication was a light that kept the darkness away from his beloved brother and sister-in-law.

**Moral of the story:** True dedication is about selfless service and protecting the ones you love, no matter the sacrifice.
