### The Sleepless Guardian

In the deep, dark forest of Dandakaranya, the moon shone like a silver coin in the sky. Prince Rama and his lovely wife, Sita, were fast asleep inside their cozy leaf hut, tired from a long day’s journey.

But someone else was wide awake.

It was Lakshmana, Rama’s devoted younger brother. He sat on a large rock outside the hut, holding his strong bow and a sharp arrow. His eyes weren't looking at the beautiful moon or the sparkling stars. They were scanning the shadows of the forest, watching and listening.

Suddenly, a twig snapped in the darkness! A pair of glowing eyes peered from behind a thick bush. Was it a hungry tiger? Or a sneaky *rakshasa* (demon) sent by the wicked Ravana?

Lakshmana didn't move a muscle. He quietly raised his bow, his face calm and ready. He was the wall that stood between danger and his beloved brother and Sita. The glowing eyes watched him for a moment, saw the fearless prince, and then slowly backed away into the night.

The sun began to rise, painting the sky with orange and pink. Rama and Sita came out of the hut, feeling refreshed and safe. They saw Lakshmana, still sitting on the rock, a gentle smile on his face. He had guarded them all through the night.

In fact, for all fourteen years they spent in the forest, Lakshmana never slept. He dedicated every single night to protecting Rama and Sita, proving his love through his selfless service.

**Moral of the story:** True love and loyalty are shown through our actions, not just our words. The greatest happiness comes from serving and protecting those we care for.
