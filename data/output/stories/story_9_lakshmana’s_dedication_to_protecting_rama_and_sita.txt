### The Guardian of the Night

Deep in the Dandaka forest, the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink. Prince Rama and his beloved wife, Sita, were tired after a long day. They made a soft bed of leaves under a giant banyan tree and soon fell into a peaceful sleep.

But Rama’s younger brother, Lakshmana, did not rest.

With his bow in hand and an arrow ready, he stood guard. The forest was full of strange sounds—the hoot of an owl, the rustle of unseen animals, the whisper of the wind. Lakshmana’s eyes scanned the darkness, watching for any danger. He drew an imaginary circle of protection around Rama and Sita with his love and courage.

All night, he stood like a silent, unmoving warrior.

When the sun rose, Rama and Sita awoke feeling safe and refreshed. They saw Lakshmana, still standing guard with a gentle smile on his face. Rama placed a hand on his brother’s shoulder, his heart full of love. He knew that while they slept, Lakshmana’s devotion had been their strongest shield.

**Moral of the story:** True love and devotion are shown not just in words, but in selfless actions to protect and care for our family.
