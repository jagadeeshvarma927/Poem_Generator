Of course! Here is a short story for children about the building of Indraprastha.

### The Magical Palace of Teamwork

Once, the five brave Pandava brothers were given a large, wild forest called Khandava. It was full of thorny bushes and huge rocks. At first, they felt sad. How could they live here?

But wise Yudhishthira, the eldest, smiled. "Don't worry, my brothers! If we work together, we can turn this jungle into a jewel."

And so they began!

Mighty Bhima, who had the strength of ten elephants, lifted giant rocks and fallen trees as if they were pillows. *Whump!* He cleared a huge space in no time.

Skillful Arjuna, the world's best archer, didn't use his arrows for fighting. Instead, he shot them to neatly cut away tangled vines and thorny bushes from far away, making safe paths for everyone. *Swish! Thwack!*

Gentle Nakula, who loved animals, planned beautiful gardens and clean stables for the horses and cows. Wise Sahadeva, who knew all about science, made sure the foundations were strong and the walls were perfectly straight.

Lord Krishna, their divine cousin, saw their incredible teamwork and was very impressed. He sent them the most magical architect in the world, Maya.

Maya was amazed by the brothers. "Because you work as one," he said, "I will build you a palace of wonders!"

With his magic, Maya created Indraprastha. The floors were so shiny they looked like pools of water, and some pools of water looked like solid floors! It was a palace of illusions and beauty, the grandest in the world.

**Moral of the story:**
Just like the five fingers of a hand, each Pandava brother was different. But when they came together, they could create magic. Teamwork is a real superpower that can help you build anything, from a sandcastle to a magnificent palace
