Of course! Here is a short story for children about the Pandavas building Indraprastha.

### The Magical Palace of Teamwork

The five Pandava brothers—Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and the twins Nakula and Sahadeva—were given a dry, barren land. But they didn't see a wasteland; they saw a dream called Indraprastha.

To help them, the magical architect Maya Danava appeared. “I can provide the magic,” he said, “but you must provide the teamwork!”

The brothers agreed.

Wise Yudhishthira drew the master plan for the city. Mighty Bhima, strong as ten elephants, lifted giant rocks and heavy wooden beams. *Wham! Thud!*

Skillful Arjuna used his arrows to clear thorny bushes and keep the workers safe. The gentle twins, Nakula and Sahadeva, planted beautiful gardens and lovingly cared for all the animals.

Working together, they built a breathtaking palace of illusions. Its shiny floors looked like pools of clear water, and its walls sparkled like diamonds. It was the most wonderful palace in the world!

The brothers stood back, proud of what their teamwork had created.

**Moral of the story:** Just as Lord Rama’s Vanara Sena worked together to build a bridge to Lanka, the Pandavas showed that when everyone combines their unique talents, they can turn an empty land into a paradise.
