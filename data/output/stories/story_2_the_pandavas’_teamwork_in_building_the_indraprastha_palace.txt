Once upon a time, the five brave Pandava brothers were given a wild, rocky land called Khandavaprastha to build their new kingdom.

"How will we build a palace here?" worried the brothers.

But Yudhishthira, the wise leader, smiled. "We will work as a team!"

Mighty Bhima used his super-strength to clear huge rocks and fallen trees. Skilful Arjuna, with the focus of an archer, carved intricate designs into the stone. The handsome twins, Nakula and Sahadeva, worked together. Nakula planted beautiful gardens and brought gentle animals, while clever Sahadeva checked that every pillar was strong and every wall was straight.

Seeing their incredible effort, the magical architect Mayasura appeared. Impressed by their unity, he offered his help.

Together, they built Indraprastha, a palace of illusions! Its floors shimmered like clear water, and its walls sparkled with gems. It was the most wonderful palace in the world, a testament to their hard work.

**Moral of the story:** Just like Hanuman needed his Vanara army to build the bridge to Lanka, the Pandavas showed that when we work together, combining our different strengths, we can create true magic.
