The five Pandava brothers stood on a dry, thorny land called Khandavaprastha. It looked sad and empty. But their dear friend, Lord Krishna, smiled. "Together," he said, "you can turn this into paradise!"

So, they got to work as a team!

Yudhishthira, the wise king, drew a master plan for a grand city. Mighty Bhima used his super strength to clear heavy rocks and trees, tossing them like pebbles. Brave Arjuna stood guard with his powerful bow, Gandiva, protecting everyone. The clever twins, Nakula and Sahadeva, planned beautiful gardens and magnificent stables for their horses.

They were helped by Maya Danava, a magical architect. He built a palace so dazzling it tricked the eyes! It had shiny floors that looked like flowing water and pools that looked like solid crystal.

Soon, the thorny land was transformed into the magnificent city of Indraprastha, a jewel on the earth. The brothers looked at their wonderful home and knew they had built it with something stronger than magic: teamwork.

**Moral of the story:** Just like how Lord Ramaâ€™s Vanara Sena built a bridge to Lanka, the Pandavas showed that when we work together and combine our unique skills, we can create wonders.
