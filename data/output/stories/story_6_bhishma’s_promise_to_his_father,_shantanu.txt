### The Prince's Promise

Once, in a kingdom by the river Ganga, lived a brave and loving prince named Devavrata. His father, King Shantanu, was the kindest king, but lately, he had been very sad.

Devavrata couldn’t bear to see his father unhappy. He discovered that the king was in love with a beautiful fisherwoman named Satyavati, but her father would only agree to the marriage if *her* children became the future kings.

This was a problem, as Prince Devavrata was the rightful heir to the throne!

To bring the smile back to his father's face, Devavrata went to Satyavati’s father and made a powerful promise. "I will give up my right to be king," he declared.

But the fisherman was still worried. "What if your children claim the throne one day?"

So, Devavrata made an even bigger, more incredible promise. "Then I shall never marry and never have children."

The gods in the heavens were so amazed by his sacrifice that they showered flowers upon him and gave him a new name: **Bhishma**, meaning “He of the incredible vow.” He kept his promise for his entire life, all for his father's happiness.

**Lesson of the story:** Keeping a promise and honoring your family are among the greatest acts of love. A person who puts others' happiness before their own is truly noble.
