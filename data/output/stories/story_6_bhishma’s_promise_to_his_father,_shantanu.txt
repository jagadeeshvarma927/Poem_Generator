Once, in the great kingdom of Hastinapura, lived the brave Prince Devavrata. His father, King Shantanu, was deeply sad, his smile gone.

The King loved Satyavati, a fisherman's daughter. Her father had one condition: "Only Satyavati's sons can be future kings!"

Seeing his father's sorrow, Devavrata’s heart ached. To bring back his father's happiness, he made a mighty promise. He declared, "I give up my right to the throne!"

But he didn't stop there. He made an even bigger vow, "I shall never marry, so my children can never challenge the future kings."

The gods in the heavens were amazed. They showered flowers and named him **Bhishma**, meaning "one of the awe-inspiring vow." His happy father granted him a boon: Bhishma could choose the moment of his own death, just like how Hanuman from the Ramayana was given boons for his devotion.

King Shantanu married Satyavati, his happiness restored, all because of his son’s great love.

**Moral of the story:** True love and respect for our parents can inspire the greatest acts of selflessness and sacrifice.
