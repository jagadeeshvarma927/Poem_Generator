### The Prince's Great Promise

In the magnificent kingdom of Hastinapura lived a brave and wonderful prince named Devavrata. He was the son of King Shantanu, and everyone knew that one day, he would be a great king.

One day, Prince Devavrata noticed his father, the King, was very sad. He wouldn't smile or laugh like he used to. Worried, Devavrata asked, "Father, what troubles you?"

The King was silent, but Devavrata soon learned the reason. His father had fallen in love with a beautiful fisherwoman named Satyavati and wanted to marry her. However, Satyavati's father had a condition. He said, "I will only let my daughter marry you if *her* sons become the kings after you, not Devavrata."

King Shantanu could never be so unfair to his own beloved son, so he returned to his palace with a heavy heart.

When Devavrata learned this, his heart filled with love for his father. To bring back his father's smile, he went to Satyavati’s father and made a promise. "I give up my right to be king," he declared. "Satyavati’s son will rule."

But the fisherman was still worried. "What if your children fight for the throne later?"

Hearing this, Devavrata made an even bigger promise, one so difficult that the heavens watched in awe. "Then I promise to never marry or have children. My promise will stand forever!"

The moment he said this, flowers rained from the sky, and the gods gave him a new name: **Bhishma**, meaning "He of the terrible vow." He had sacrificed everything for his father's happiness.

**Moral of the story:**
The story of Bhishma teaches us about selfless love and the power of a promise. True strength lies not in what you get, but in what you are willing to give for the happiness of those you love.
