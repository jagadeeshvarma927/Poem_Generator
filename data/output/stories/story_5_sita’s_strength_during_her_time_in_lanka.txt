### The Little Sapling in Lanka

In the lush gardens of Lanka, surrounded by the most beautiful flowers, lived the gentle Queen Sita. But this garden, called Ashok Vatika, was a prison. The mighty ten-headed king, Ravana, had brought her there and wanted her to be his queen.

Every day, Ravana would come and offer her mountains of gold and chests of sparkling jewels. "Just say yes, Sita," he would boom, his ten heads nodding. "You will be the most powerful queen in the world!"

But Sita's strength was not in gold or crowns. It was in her heart. She would look at him bravely and say, "Ravana, a heart full of love and hope is richer than all your treasures. My heart belongs to Rama."

Angry, Ravana would stomp away.

Alone, Sita never let despair win. She found a tiny, weak sapling struggling to grow in the shade of a large tree. Every day, she would give it a few drops of water and clear the weeds around it.

She whispered to the little plant, "Grow strong, little one. Be patient and keep reaching for the sun. Just like you, my hope is small but it is alive."

The sapling grew taller and stronger, and so did Sitaâ€™s spirit. She knew that just as the sun would surely find the little plant, her dear Rama would surely find her. Her patience and faith were her shield and her sword.

**Moral of the story:**
True strength isn't always about physical power. It is the courage, hope, and kindness you keep inside your heart, even in the most difficult times.
