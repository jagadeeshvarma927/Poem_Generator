Of course! Here is a short story for children about Sita's strength.

### The Unbreakable Spirit

Princess Sita was far from her beloved Rama. She was in Lanka, in a beautiful garden called the Ashoka Vatika. But even with fragrant flowers all around, she was sad.

The ten-headed king, Ravana, would often visit. "Marry me, Sita!" he would boom. "I will give you gold palaces and sparkling jewels!"

But Sita was stronger than any jewel. She would stand tall, her eyes full of courage, and say, "A palace is just a cage without love and respect. My heart belongs only to Rama."

The guards around her would try to scare her, but Sita found strength in small things. She would talk to the trees, remembering her walks in the forest with Rama. She held onto her hope like a tiny, warm light in the dark.

One day, the mighty Hanuman found her. He offered to carry her back to safety. But Sita, with great dignity, said, "Thank you, brave Hanuman. But it is Rama's dharma (duty) to defeat injustice and rescue me. Tell him I am waiting, and my spirit is not broken."

**Lesson:** True strength isn't about fighting with fists. It's the courage and hope you hold inside your heart, even when you are scared or alone.
