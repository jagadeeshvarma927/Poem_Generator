Far away on the island of Lanka, Princess Sita was held in a beautiful garden called the Ashoka Vatika. The ten-headed king, Ravana, would visit her, offering mountains of gold and palaces made of glittering gems if she would be his queen.

But Sita, with a calm and brave heart, always shook her head. "My strength is not for sale," she would say firmly. "It comes from my love for Rama and my belief in what is right."

The scary rakshasi guards tried to frighten her with loud noises and mean faces. But Sita remained as peaceful as a lotus flower in a pond, untouched by the mud around it. Every day, she would pray and hold onto the hope that Rama would find her.

When the brave Hanuman finally found her, he wasn't just amazed by her beauty, but by her incredible inner fire. He saw that even though she was a prisoner, her spirit was free and stronger than any chain.

**Moral of the story:** True strength isn't about muscles or magic swords. It is the courage that shines from within your heart, even in the darkest of times.
