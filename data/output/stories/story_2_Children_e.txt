**The Magical River Stone**

On a sunny day, in a small village, three friends—Ravi, Leela, and Kishan—played by the riverside. The clear water sparkled, and the warm sun shone through the trees. They skipped stones and built sandcastles, laughing joyfully.

While Ravi waded through the shallow water, he found a shiny object. "Look!" he exclaimed, holding up a glowing stone. As they gathered around, the stone began to glow, and a gentle breeze rustled the trees.

Suddenly, Hanuman, the mighty monkey god from the Ramayana, appeared before them. "Hello, young friends," he said with a smile. "I have been watching you. You have kind hearts, and this stone has chosen you to share a special message."

Hanuman explained, "Courage is not just about strength; it's about helping others. Remember, true strength lies in kindness and support."

Inspired, the children decided to help an elderly neighbor who struggled with chores. Together, they carried firewood and fetched water, making her day brighter.

As the sun set, Hanuman reappeared, proud of their actions. "You have learned the true meaning of courage. Always remember to help one another."

From that day on, Ravi, Leela, and Kishan spread joy and kindness throughout their village, proving that courage and compassion go hand in hand.
