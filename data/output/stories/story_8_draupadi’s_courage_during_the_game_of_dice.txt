In the grand kingdom of Hastinapur, the five noble Pandava princes were tricked by their jealous cousins, the Kauravas, in a game of dice. They lost their kingdom, their wealth, and even their freedom.

The wicked prince Duryodhana then ordered his brother to bring the Pandavas' wife, the brave Queen Draupadi, to the court. But Draupadi was filled with courage. Instead of being scared, she stood tall and her voice rang out like a lionessâ€™s roar.

"You have no right to command me!" she declared. "A king who has lost himself has no power to stake anyone else!"

Ignoring her words, the cruel men tried to dishonour her by pulling at her sari. Draupadi closed her eyes and prayed with all her might to Lord Krishna. A miracle unfolded! As they pulled her sari, it magically kept getting longer and longer, piling up in a mountain of beautiful cloth. The villains grew tired and fell back in shame, defeated by her unbreakable spirit.

**Moral of the story:** True strength is not in muscles, but in courage and faith. When you stand up for what is right, even when you are alone, the universe will come to your aid.
