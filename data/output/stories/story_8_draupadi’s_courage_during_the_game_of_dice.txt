In the grand kingdom of Hastinapura, the five noble Pandava princes were tricked into a game of dice by their jealous cousin, Duryodhana. One by one, the eldest Pandava, King Yudhishthira, lost his kingdom, his brothers, and even himself.

The wicked Duryodhana then ordered his brother, Dushasana, to cruelly pull the brave Queen Draupadi into the court.

But Draupadi was a fire of courage. Instead of weeping, she stood tall and asked a powerful question that silenced everyone: "How can a man who has already lost himself, stake his wife?"

When the evil Dushasana tried to dishonour her by pulling her sari, Draupadi closed her eyes and prayed with all her heart to her friend, Lord Krishna. A miracle unfolded! As Dushasana pulled, the sari magically kept growing longer and longer, like a colourful, endless river. He pulled until he fell, exhausted and defeated.

Draupadi’s courage and faith had saved her.

**Moral of the story:** True strength is not just in your muscles. It is the courage to speak up against what is wrong and to have faith that good will always be protected, just as Lord Rama’s faith helped him defeat the mighty Ravana.
