In the grand kingdom of Hastinapur, the five brave Pandava princes were invited by their jealous cousin, Duryodhana, to a game of dice. With them was their wise and graceful queen, Draupadi.

Duryodhana’s uncle, Shakuni, was a tricky man who used magic dice that always obeyed him. One by one, the eldest Pandava, Yudhishthira, lost everything—his kingdom, his wealth, and even his brothers. Finally, in a moment of great sorrow, he was tricked into losing Queen Draupadi.

Duryodhana laughed cruelly and ordered for Draupadi to be dragged into the court. The Pandavas sat with their heads bowed in shame, unable to do anything.

But Draupadi was not just a queen; she was a woman of immense courage. As she was brought into the hall full of kings and warriors, she did not weep. Instead, she stood tall and spoke with a voice as clear as a temple bell.

"I have a question for this assembly," she declared. "Did the king lose himself first, or did he lose me? A man who has already lost his own freedom cannot bet anyone else!"

Her powerful words silenced the entire court. The greatest warriors and wisest elders had no answer. Her intelligence and bravery shone brighter than any jewel. When Duryodhana’s brother tried to shame her, she prayed to her dear friend, Lord Krishna. A miracle occurred! Her saree became endless, protecting her from all harm.

The villains were left stunned, defeated not by a sword, but by a queen's fearless spirit and her unshakeable faith.

**Moral of the story:** True strength is not just about physical power. It is about having the courage to speak the truth and stand up for what is right, even when you feel all alone.
